Welcome to SDR Setup's documentation!
===================================

This project is intended to provide instructions for setting up a few SDR's on a few different platforms including Linux and Raspberry Pi.

The project is broken down into the different SDRs used and the environments the SDRs are connected to. The tutorials are setup to explain how to setup the given environment and how to setup the SDRs to run on those environments.
The pages are broken down to the different environments where it will explain how to set them up, and the different SDRs where it will explain how to set them up for a specific environment.
